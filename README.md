# make a todo list!

_work in progress_
This is a very light weight client side app for making todo lists with a checkbox system. Hack it into whatever you want :) currently the two .js files are dependent on each other to work fully... fireworks on the completion of the list. 

I am reminded of theme park on the old sega megadrive for some reason.
